description: Runs a Checkmarx ASCA (AI Security Code Assistant) scan on source files to detect SAST vulnerabilities, and remediates findings using the Checkmarx MCP tool. Use when a user asks to scan or fix their code, or when SAST vulnerabilities detected by ASCA need to be fixed. Invoke as: cx-security:cx-security-asca

# CX Security ASCA

Detects and remediates SAST vulnerabilities in source files using Checkmarx ASCA.

## When to Use

This skill has two entry points:

1. **On-demand scan** — User explicitly asks to scan their code (e.g., "scan this file", "check my code for security issues")
2. **Remediation** — User asks to fix ASCA findings, or Claude needs to fix SAST vulnerabilities detected by ASCA

> **If ASCA findings are already present in context** (e.g., provided by a hook block or a prior scan result), **skip Flow 1 entirely** and proceed directly to Flow 2 using those findings. Do not re-run the scan.

## Prerequisites

- Checkmarx `cx` CLI installed and available in PATH
- Checkmarx MCP server connected (required for remediation)

---

## Flow 1: On-Demand Scan

### Step 1 — Identify Files to Scan

Ask the user which file(s) to scan if not already specified.

### Step 2 — Run the ASCA Scan

Run the scan on each file:

```bash
cx scan asca -s "<file-path>"
```

### Step 3 — Process Results

The scan returns a JSON response:

```json
{
  "request_id": "<uuid>",
  "status": true,
  "message": "Scan successful",
  "scan_details": [
    {
      "rule_id": 4059,
      "language": "Python",
      "rule_name": "Unsafe use of 'shell=True' in subprocess without 'shlex.quote'",
      "severity": "High",
      "file_name": "example.py",
      "line": 38,
      "problematicLine": "<the offending line of code>",
      "length": 155,
      "remediationAdvise": "<how to fix it>",
      "description": "<explanation of the vulnerability>"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **If `scan_details` is empty** — Inform the user the file passed the ASCA security scan with no findings.
- **If `scan_details` has findings** — Report each finding:
  - `rule_name` — vulnerability type
  - `severity` — Critical / High / Medium / Low
  - `file_name` and `line` — location
  - `description` — what the vulnerability is
  - `remediationAdvise` — how to fix it

  Then ask the user: **"Would you like me to remediate these findings?"**
  If yes, proceed to the Remediation flow below.

---

## Flow 2: Remediation

Triggered either after the user confirms in Flow 1, or when SAST vulnerabilities detected by ASCA need to be fixed.

Perform all steps **completely and autonomously** — no user interaction.

### Step 1 — Detect Language

Determine the programming language of the affected file. If unknown, leave `language` empty.

### Step 2 — Call `mcp__Checkmarx__codeRemediation`

For each finding, call the `mcp__Checkmarx__codeRemediation` tool:

```json
{
  "language": "[auto-detected programming language]",
  "metadata": {
    "ruleId": "[rule_name from scan]",
    "description": "[description from scan]",
    "remediationAdvice": "[remediationAdvise from scan]"
  },
  "type": "sast"
}
```

- If the tool is **available**: parse `remediation_steps` from the response and proceed to Step 3.
- If the tool is **not available**: display:
  `[MCP ERROR] mcp__Checkmarx__codeRemediation tool is not available. Please check the Checkmarx MCP server.`

### Step 3 — Apply the Fix

- Execute each instruction in `remediation_steps` in order.
- **Only modify code at or around the problematic line** (`line` from scan results) — do not touch unrelated code.
- For each change, track:
  - File modified
  - Line number
  - Type of change (e.g., input validation, sanitization, secure API usage)
  - Before → after values

### Step 4 — Re-scan

After all fixes are applied, re-run:

```bash
cx scan asca -s "<file-path>"
```

Confirm all findings are resolved. If new findings appear, repeat the Remediation flow for them.

### Step 5 — Output Remediation Summary

```
Remediation Summary

Rule:             [rule_name]
Severity:         [severity]
Issue Type:       SAST Security Vulnerability
Problematic Line: [line]

Files Modified:
1. [file]
   - Line [n]: [description of change]
   - [additional changes]
```

**Final status:**
- ✅ All fixed: "Remediation completed for security rule [rule_name]. Build status: PASS. Security tests: PASS."
- ⚠️ Partially fixed: "Remediation partially completed — manual review required. TODOs inserted where applicable."
- ❌ Failed: "Remediation failed for security rule [rule_name]. Reason: [summary]. Unresolved issues listed above."

### Constraints

- Do not prompt the user
- Do not skip or reorder fix steps
- Only modify code corresponding to the identified problematic line
- Insert clear `TODO` comments for unresolved issues
- Remediation must be deterministic, auditable, and fully automated
